# Mach 4 Avid CNC
 

Customizations for the default Avid profile in Mach 4.

### This is a modification of the original Corbin profile. I modified it for the S30C spindle from CNCDepot, integrated the code for the Avid 15W laser, and modified for use with Avid Mach4 version 2.5.5. ### -Lazerwolf22

### Cycle Start Check
This is a basic check that ensures the Gcode file is on line 1. If it isn't, the user is prompted to continue. Stopping a cycle or eStopping doesn't rewind the GCode file, and I would not remember to rewind it before hitting cycle start. This caused some air cutting without the spindle being on. To prevent this, the user is explicitly prompted if they really want to cycle start.

### Feed Rate Sliders
**TODO**: Change the feed rate to sliders, as the inc/dec buttons are terrible. Tormach's PathPilot does this and is way better to fine tune the rates.
	
	
### Automatic Tool Changer / ATC
This is the big stuff - an easy way to setup ATC tool pockets for a linear ATC tool rack. You can have your tool pockets in any orientation and at any location. The pockets can contain any tool, and you can easily swap them out.
